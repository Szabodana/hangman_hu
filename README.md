# hangman_hu
Scrapes a given website for words using Beautifulsoup, cleans them and selects one randomly and starts a simple hangman game. 
For some inexplicable reason I've written everything in Hungarian, including the variables and comments.

I'm fully aware that this code would make any experienced programmer weep, but the point was to create something without using any kind of guide.:D
