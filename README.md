# hangman_hu
Scrapes a given website for words using Beautifulsoup, cleans them and selects one randomly, then starts a simple hangman game. It searches for the "a" tag in html, so hopefully it can find something in almost all URLs.

For some inexplicable reason I've written everything in Hungarian, including the variables and comments.

I'm fully aware that this code would make any experienced programmer weep, but the point was to create something without using any kind of guide.:D
